# Tableau.Airbnb_Turkey_Analysis
This project analyzes Airbnb listings in Istanbul using 2025 data to understand pricing dynamics, host quality, and revenue patterns across districts and room types.

The dataset was created by performing an inner join between Listings and Calendar data, followed by data cleaning and transformation in Tableau. Due to missing and null values in calendar price fields, the analysis primarily relies on listing-level price data.

-Key Questions Explored

How do average Airbnb prices vary across Istanbul districts?

How does room type affect pricing?

Do Superhosts receive higher guest ratings than non-Superhosts?

What is the relationship between guest capacity and estimated revenue?

How do price, reviews, and ratings interact with each other?

Pricing and revenue in Istanbul’s Airbnb market are primarily driven by location and room type, while host quality (Superhost status) contributes to marginally higher guest satisfaction. Increasing capacity boosts revenue only up to a certain point, after which returns decline.
